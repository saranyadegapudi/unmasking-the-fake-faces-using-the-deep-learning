# Unmasking the fake faces using deep-learning techniques
User Manuel

This Manuel includes Steps, to perform the deep learning Project.
1. Before working on the project some of the libraries and packages should be installed such as pip,torchvision,json, copy tensorflow,numpy, pandas,matplot, seaborn.
2. Then either download the Dataset into your system or in code from Kaggle, as the dataset is downloaded from many sources which all are mentioned in the project report.
3. The dataset needs to be Preprocessed because the datasets provide clear labels indicating whether a video has undergone manipulation, ensuring consistency in evaluation metrics. 
4. The inclusion of real-world scenarios, such as celebrities and diverse facial manipulations, enhances the dataset's applicability to practical use cases
  Then the dataset must be split into 80-20 ratio, for training and testing.
 5. Now implement the algorithms :
  i)CNN
  ii)LSTM
  iii)ResNext 50 model
  6. Code for all these above-mentioned algorithms is given in a .ipynb Ô¨Åle containing output, graphs, and visualization, for the algorithms. You can see and analyze from there which algorithm gives us the best performance.
